abstract = {The actual development of the Internet of Things (IoT) needs major issues related to things' service discovery and composition to be addressed. This paper proposes a possible approach to solve such issues. We introduce a novel paradigm of "social network of intelligent objects", namely the Social Internet of Things (SIoT), based on the notion of social relationships among objects. Following the definition of a possible social structure among objects, a preliminary architecture for the implementation of SIoT is presented. Through the SIoT paradigm, the capability of humans and devices to discover, select, and use objects with their services in the IoT is augmented. Besides, a level of trustworthiness is enabled to steer the interaction among the billions of objects which will crowd the future IoT.},

Implementations of the SIoT model envision cyber counterparts of physical objects--social virtual objects--virtualized in the cloud. Such an approach has several advantages but suffers from a few major problems. In fact, objects might be located far from the datacenter hosting the cloud, resulting in long delays and inefficient use of communication resources. This article investigates how to address these issues by exploiting the computing resources at the edge of the network to host the virtual objects of the SIoT and provides early experimental results.},

Moreover, by improving the reliability of the power system and, in the long term, lowering peak demand, DR reduces overall plant and capital cost investments and postpones the need for network upgrades. In this paper a survey of DR potentials and benefits in smart grids is presented.

In this paper, a multi-agent decentralized energy management system was designed. In particular, the devices of the microgrid under study were controlled as interactive agents. The energy management problem was formulated here through the application of game theory, in order to model the set of strategies between two players/agents, as a non-cooperative power control game or a cooperative one, according to the level of the energy produced by the renewable energy sources and the energy stored in the battery bank, for the purpose of accomplishing optimal energy management and control of the microgrid operation. The Nash equilibrium was used to compromise the possible diverging goals of the agents by maximizing their preferences. The proposed energy management system was then compared with a multi-agent decentralized energy management system where all the agents were assumed to be cooperative and employed agent coordination through Fuzzy Cognitive Maps. The results obtained from this comparison, demonstrate that the application of game theory based control, in autonomous polygeneration microgrids, can ensure operational and financial benefits over known energy management approaches incorporating distributed intelligence.},

The first feature has been introduced by adopting the social IoT concept, according to which objects are capable of establishing social relationships in an autonomous way with respect to their owners with the benefits of improving the network scalability and information discovery efficiency. The major components of PaaS services are used for an easy management and development of applications by both users and programmers. The reusability allows the programmers to generate templates of objects and services available to the whole Lysis community. The data generated by the devices is stored at the object owners cloud spaces. This paper also presents a use-case that illustrates the implementation choices and the use of the Lysis features.},

High demands and environmental concerns, force the transformation of electricity grids into smart grids, towards more rational utilization of energy. Residential smart metering transforms homes into energy-aware environments, allowing residents to make informed choices about electricity. Web-based smart homes employ Web principles to interconnect electrical appliances. The Web, as a highly ubiquitous platform, can be used to connect energy-aware smart homes to the smart grid. An important characteristic of the future grid is demand response, defined as real-time pricing, according to supply conditions. Energy-aware smart homes can exploit this capability to schedule electricity-related tasks for future execution. We investigate this possibility by deploying a Web-based, energyaware smart home, adapted to demand response. An initial technical study denotes the feasibility of our approach and a small survey indicates the potential for saving energy and money.},

From a large scale point of view, it combines the electric power system itself and a heterogeneous information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure. Additionally, these systems are composed by many building blocks that are designed and managed as separated systems which are hard to fully integrate between each other. Relying on the experiences arisen and the knowledge gathered from the partners during the development of the FP7 European projects INTEGRIS (intelligent electrical grid sensor communications) and FINESCE (future internet smart utility services), this paper presents the software defined utility (SDU) concept for the management of the smart grid and its security, which advocates for the migration of the utility infrastructure to software systems instead of relying on complex and rigid hardware based systems. Following this approach, SDU proposes the evolution of power systems' ICT and the usage of programmable commodity hardware, low-cost sensors, and reliable high-speed IP-based communications underneath. More concretely, this paper proposes some building blocks for the deployment of the SDU (flexible data management infrastructure, context-aware security and web of things interface) and evaluates their functionalities and benefits for the smart grids of the future.},

In this paper we survey the{\&}{\#}x2014;admittedly babelian{\&}{\#}x2014;standardization landscape of IoT and present its major efforts. Our survey concludes with a comparative discussion that highlights the key challenges of future standardisation in IoT.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has been evolving towards the creation of a cyber-physical world where everything can be found, activated, probed, interconnected, and updated, so that any possible interaction, both virtual and/or physical, can take place. Crucial concept of this paradigm is that of the virtual object, which is the digital counterpart of any real (human or lifeless, static or mobile, solid or intangible) entity in the IoT. It has now become a major component of the current IoT platforms, supporting the discovery and mash up of services, fostering the creation of complex applications, improving the objects energy management eciency, as well as addressing heterogeneity and scalability issues. This paper aims at providing the reader with a survey of the virtual object in the IoT world. Virtualness is addressed from several perspectives: historical evolution of its definitions; current functionalities assigned to the virtual object and how they tackle the main IoT challenges; major IoT platforms which implement these functionalities. Finally, we illustrate the lessons learned after having acquired a comprehensive view of the topic.},

abstract = {Smart grid has opened up a new role of "prosumer" in an energy value network, transforming many conventional energy consumers into prosumers, who not only generate green energy but also share the surplus with utilities and other consumers. The concept of a goal-oriented prosumer community group (PCG) has emerged recently as an effective way to fulfill sustainable energy exchange. Such community-based energy sharing networks comprise multiple irreconcilable objectives such as demand constraints, cost constraints, and income maximization. In many cases, one goal may be achievable only at the expense of other goals. This necessitates the development of an effective framework to manage the multiple goals and reduce the gap with their achievement levels. Therefore, in this research paper, an effective framework is developed to negotiate among the multiple goals and thus to define optimal mutual goals for each PCG in a more sustainable manner using multiple-criteria goal programming techniques. Simulation results are presented to illustrate how the methods work in practical situations, where each of the objective measure is given a target value and the unwanted deviations from this set are minimized in an achievement function.},

abstract = {In a smart grid environment, economic operation means not only to economic scheduling of generation, but also to scheduling the load. In a Microgrid (MG), which comprises of intermittent Distributed Generators (DGs) (eg. solar and wind energy sources), the need of Demand Side Management (DSM)/ Demand Response (DR) becomes significant. The key point in DSM is to shift the load to some other point in time, this causes inconvenience to the customer and therefore it should be minimized. Minimizing the cost of generation and also minimizing the inconvenience caused due to shifting of loads is a multiobjective optimization problem. In this work the authors consider an industrial/ commercial MG with one solar source, two diesel generators and one battery, with the assumption that the utility grid uses dynamic pricing. The objective function contains discontinuous functions which will be difficult to solve using conventional optimization techniques and hence a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based solution is proposed. The simulation results show that there is savings for the customer with DSM compared to the case without DSM.},

However, currently, society is faced with the problem of dwindling and scarce non-renewable energy resources, resulting in a shortage of energy. Moreover, the process of energy production from non-renewable sources is increasing greenhouse gas emissions, leading to unpleasant and potentially dangerous climatic changes. Therefore, in today?s world, the focus is on inducing users to reduce their household energy consumption, and shift to using energy produced from renewable sources, such as solar, water, and wind. Not only this, but users are being encouraged to generate the green energy, and to either store the surplus for future usage or to feed it back into the utility grid. In order to evolve such bidirectional energy and information flow, the concept of the smart-grid has been proposed [1].},

This works reasonably well under ordinary circumstances but breaks downoften catastrophicallyunder stress. Individual motivation, long response times, and poor situation awareness interfere with operation and can even cause breakdowns. Broadly distributed operations would more robust and fail more gracefully than centralized systems, but remain unlikely given the difficulty in operating large infrastructures even with modern Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. The solution is management by distributed software that maintains normal operation, enforces operational and security policy, deals with contingencies, and protects against malicious indsiders, errors, and outright attacks. We specify a distributed agent coalition able to accomplish this for distributed electric power and describe a prototype implementation based on Sandia-developed technology.},

The benefits are those of improving scalability in information/service discovery when the SIoT is made of huge numbers of heterogeneous nodes, similarly to what happens with social networks among humans. In this paper we focus on the problem of understanding how the information provided by the other members of the SIoT has to be processed so as to build a reliable system on the basis of the behavior of the objects. We define a subjective model for the management of trustworthiness which builds upon the solutions proposed for P2P networks. Each node computes the trustworthiness of its friends on the basis of its own experience and on the opinion of the common friends with the potential service providers. We employ a feedback system and we combine the credibility and centrality of the nodes to evaluate the trust level. Preliminary simulations show the benefits of the proposed model towards the isolation of almost any malicious node in the network.},

It challenges the design and evaluation of IoT systems to meet the scalability, compatibility, extendibility, dynamic adaptability and resiliency requirements. In this paper, we design and evaluate a scalable, adaptive and survivable trust management protocol in dynamic IoT environments. Recognizing that entities in an IoT system are connected through social networks of entity owners, we consider a community of interest (CoI) based social IoT where nodes form into communities of interest. Given inter-CoI vs. intra-CoI social connections among entity owners as input, we identify best trust protocol settings for achieving convergence, accuracy, dynamic adaptability and resiliency properties in the presence of dynamically changing conditions and malicious nodes performing trust-related attacks. For scalability, we consider a design by which a node only keeps trust information of a subset of nodes meeting its interest and performs minimum computation to update trust. We validate our design by extensive simulation considering both limited and ideal (unlimited) storage space. The results demonstrate that our trust management protocol using limited storage space achieves a similar performance level compared with the one under ideal storage space, and a newly joining node can quickly build up trust towards other nodes with desirable accuracy and convergence behavior.},

A simple and efficient mobility model such as SWIM reflects correctly kernel properties of human movement and, at the same time, allows to evaluate accurately protocols in this context. In this paper we investigate the properties of SWIM, in particular how SWIM is able to generate social behavior among the nodes and how SWIM is able to model networks with a power-law exponential decay dichotomy of inter contact time and with complex sub-structures (communities) as the ones observed in the real data traces. We simulate three real scenarios and compare the synthetic data with real world data in terms of inter-contact, contact duration, number of contacts, and presence and structure of communities among nodes and find out a very good matching. By comparing the performance of BUBBLE, a community-based forwarding protocol for social mobile networks, on both real and synthetic data traces, we show that SWIM not only is able to extrapolate key properties of human mobility but also is very accurate in predicting performance of protocols based on social human sub-structures.},

Trust management plays an important role in IoT for reliable data fusion and mining, qualified services with context-awareness, and enhanced user privacy and information security. It helps people overcome perceptions of uncertainty and risk and engages in user acceptance and consumption on IoT services and applications. However, current literature still lacks a comprehensive study on trust management in IoT. In this paper, we investigate the properties of trust, propose objectives of IoT trust management, and provide a survey on the current literature advances towards trustworthy IoT. Furthermore, we discuss unsolved issues, specify research challenges and indicate future research trends by proposing a research model for holistic trust management in IoT. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Building energy consumption estimation has become a key approach to achieve the goals on energy consumption and emissions reduction. Energy performance of building is complicated since it depends on multiple variables associated to the building characteristics, equipment and systems, weather, occupants, and sociological influences. This paper aims to provide an up-to-date review on the basics of building energy estimation. Regarding models, a classification for energy estimation models is proposed based on the different classifications found in the literature review. The paper focuses on models developed with whole building energy simulation software and their validation. This focus is justified because of the importance that whole building energy tools have gained on areas such as green building design, and analysis of energy conservation strategies and retrofits.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. Efficient energy usage inside buildings is a critical problem, particularly for high loads such as the Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems: over 30{\%} of the global energy consumption resides in HVAC usage inside buildings. Usage awareness and efficient management of HVAC have the potential to significantly reduce related costs. Nevertheless, strict saving policies may contrast with users' comfort. This paper proposes a Smart HVAC system where a trade-off between energy costs and thermal comfort of users is achieved. This user-centric approach takes advantage of the Social Internet of Things (SIoT) paradigm to augment real world objects with a virtual counterpart that leverages social consciousness to interact with other objects. Accordingly, a building thermal profile is characterized to drive the selection of the most appropriate working times for the HVAC. Experimental results prove that the implemented system is able to adapt to user's needs and ensure an acceptable comfort level while at the same time reducing energy costs with reference to static or traditional scenarios.},

abstract = {Power systems' operators have the task of maintaining the balance between the demand and generation of electric power. Much research and attention is being given to find more environmental friendly sources of power generation. Naturally, more power is required when the load is at its peak value, and this tends to be when the most non environmentally friendly sources of power generation are used. This paper proposes a new controller for peak load shaving by intelligently scheduling power consumption of domestic electric water heater using binary particle swarm optimization. Past studies show that similar demand side management programs were not successful because the impact that the load control has on the end users' comfort. In this study, Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) finds the optimal load demand schedule for minimizing the peak load demand while maximizing customer comfort level. A simulation in Matlab is used to test the performance of the demand response program using field data gathered by smart meters from 200 households. The direct load control is shown to be an effective tool for peak shaving of load demand, shifting the loads to valleys and reducing the aggregated load of electricity without compromising customer satisfaction.},

Equalizing the power consumption in industry may lead to the utilization of power in other service areas in an efficient way. Although industries have comparably lesser number of power consuming device types than other service areas the power consumption is quite high. To meet the demands rising in the industry, shiftable loads (devices) can be redistributed equally to all the working time slots based on the average power utilization. It can be done in a flexible manner by shaping the loads using Demand Side Management (DSM) tech-nique in Smart Grid. The main objective is to minimize the power utilization during the electricity rush hour by effectively distributing the power available during off-peak hour. Evolutionary algorithm can be well adapted to problems where optimization is the core criteria. Any maximization or minimization problem can be solved efficiently using evo-lutionary algorithm. Hence, to obtain the optimized fitness function of load redistribution in industry Genetic Algorithm in Demand Side Management (GA-DSM) is chosen and it has benefited with an overall reduction of 21.91{\%} which is very remarkable.

abstract = {Interruptible loads represent highly valuable demand side resources within the electricity industry. However, maximizing their potential value in terms of system security and scheduling is a considerable challenge because of their widely varying and potentially complex operational characteristics. This paper investigates the use of binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) to schedule a significant number of varied interruptible loads over 16 h. The scheduling objective is to achieve a system requirement of total hourly curtailments while satisfying the operational constraints of the available interruptible loads, minimizing the total payment to them and minimizing the frequency of interruptions imposed upon them. This multiobjective optimization problem was simplified by using a single aggregate objective function. The BPSO algorithm proved capable of achieving near-optimal solutions in manageable computational time-frames for this relatively complex, nonlinear and noncontinuous problem. The effectiveness of the approach was further improved by dividing the swarm into several subswarms. The proposed scheduling technique demonstrated useful performance for a relatively challenging scheduling task, and would seem to offer some potential advantages in scheduling significant numbers of widely varied and technically complex interruptible loads.},

This study presents the future challenges and the state of the art of research works that study new concepts for the power systems of the future, with a particular focus on the Web-of-Cells concept, multi-micro-grids, the fractal grid approach and autonomic power systems.},

abstract = {Energy conservation is a global issue with great implications. High energy demands and environmental concerns force the transformation of electricity grids into smart grids, towards more rational utilization of energy. Embedded computing and smart metering transform houses into energy-aware environments, allowing residents to make informed choices about electricity. Web technologies are successfully used for managing heterogeneous home devices, facilitating the remote management of the house through Web APIs. Hence, the Web, as an ubiquitous and scalable platform, is suitable for interconnecting energy-aware smart homes and the smart grid. In this paper, we investigate the possibilities created when energy-aware smart homes communicate in near real-time with the smart grid and we propose an architecture for their flexible integration to the grid, through the Web. A proof of concept deployment is performed and general security aspects are discussed. The potential of this Web-based architecture is demonstrated by developing two applications that exploit these new capabilities of smart homes, towards an intelligent grid. Demand response is harnessed to schedule electricity-related tasks for future execution and load shedding is employed to reduce the total load for avoiding outages. Finally, issues such as peak leveling, fault tolerance, billing and a market for energy are briefly discussed.},

@article{Esther2016,
abstract = {The residential sector is a major contributor to the global energy balance. So far, the residential users demand has been largely uncontrollable and inelastic with respect to the power grid conditions. Demand Side Management (DSM) is an important function in smart grid that allows consumers to make informed decision regarding energy consumption, and helps energy providers to reshape the load profile and to reduce peak load demand. DSM can be mathematically formulated either to maximize the system total peak demand or to maximize overall system load factor and utility's revenue and to minimize customer electricity bill. This paper reviews the various optimization techniques applied to DSM as contrasting characteristics like individual users versus cooperative users, deterministic versus stochastic and day-ahead versus real time DSM. This paper reviews a survey on residential DSM, which can help general readers to have an outlook of the topic which includes the architecture, formulation of optimization problems and its various approaches. The issues, existing solutions and approaches are presented. In addition, the future research directions are also discussed to enhance the work in this domain.},
